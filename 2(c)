(c) Demonstrate Continuous Integration and Development using Jenkins

Now you’ll set up Jenkins to automatically build/test (and later deploy) your project whenever you push updates to GitHub.

🔧 1. Install Jenkins

Download jenkins.msi from https://www.jenkins.io/download/

Install it → open http://localhost:8080

Unlock using the initial password from:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword


Install Suggested Plugins

Create Admin user → Continue

🔗 2. Connect Jenkins with GitHub

In Jenkins → New Item → Freestyle Project → name it “RegistrationForm-CI”

Under Source Code Management, select Git

Add your GitHub repo URL:

https://github.com/<your-username>/registration-form.git


Under Build Triggers, check ✅
"GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling"

Under Build Steps, choose Execute Windows batch command and enter:

echo "Building project..."
dir
echo "Build successful!"


Click Save, then Build Now

✅ Jenkins will clone your project, run the build steps, and show a green ✅ build.
